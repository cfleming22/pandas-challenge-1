# Pandas Challenge 1: Wholesale Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes wholesale client data to identify top customers, calculate profitability, and verify order totals. The analysis includes data exploration, transformation, and verification of calculations.


## Features
- Data exploration and category analysis
- Order calculations with shipping and tax
- Order total verification
- Client performance analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pandas-challenge-1.git
cd pandas-challenge-1
```

2. Ensure the dataset is in the Resources directory
3. Open and run wholesale_data_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Process
1. Data Exploration
   - Examined column names and basic statistics
   - Identified top categories and subcategories
   - Analyzed top 5 clients by order frequency

2. Data Transformation
   - Calculated line subtotals and shipping costs
   - Applied tax calculations
   - Computed line costs and profits

3. Verification
   - Confirmed calculations against provided order totals
   - Validated shipping price calculations
   - Verified tax applications

4. Summary Analysis
   - Created client performance summaries
   - Formatted currency values
   - Generated final insights
